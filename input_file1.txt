i had an interesting conversation the other day a radiologist was giving me an x-ray what do you do for a living he asked i am a writer  i said his mouth arched into a smile  and a laugh that indicated excitement followed wow  that is amazing  he said i have never met such a young writer before normally  i would brush such uncomplimentary compliments aside what does being a writer even mean but this man expressed his enthusiasm with an honest exhilaration that i could not ignore his energy plagued my mind  and moments later  it created an imposter syndrome that manifested these thoughts  what is so amazing about being a writer oh no  he thinks i write books i am not a writer i mean  i write words for a living but i have never written a book i am technically a professional writer my day job is as a ux writer  and my side project is writing here on medium the income that sustains me comes from my ability to spill words out of my body and onto a page okay  it is a screen  but page sounds so much cooler so by all definitions  i am a professional  though the only thing that means is that i make money from it but i don not feel like a writer some people i tell i am a writer react with a passion that shadows a pressure on me that i can not handle like the radiologist it is as if my mental model of what i do is so detached from theirs they think i am a wise wizard who casts spells that produce the worlds in my mind i don not do that  i just write if i may make a presumptuous assumption  i think it is because they associate writer with author but i am biased because i don not think i am cool and i think authors are pretty damn cool the good ones  at least authors create entire journeys of words that encapsulate essential parts of the human experience they make build worlds so wonderful that others can not help but fall in love with their flawed characters i don not do anything close to what authors do at best  i write 5000 words  at worst  i write 500 words sure  word count doesn not signify value but my words don not have the complex rhetoric of poems nor the vision of short stories all i do is write about my own experiences  there is nothing difficult about that some people love my writing  but it doesn not feel like a hurdling challenge that makes me remarkable the result  i feel a wicked imposter syndrome every time i tell someone i am a writer i hate it i don not see myself as a writer i don not feel like i have earned the title i don not know if other writers feel this way  especially because there are people who barely write who are happy to slap on writer as a title like those snarky achievement-less individuals on linkedin my imposter syndrome runs deep i don not even identify as a writer on medium  which is fucking weird because everyone who reads my stories would consider me to be one my profile description says words instead of writer because that is what i think i do i do words yes  that precisely means i am a writer but i hate the connotations behind writer it feels so wrong the funny thing is  i am happy to give the title of writer to others on medium i just can not handle labeling myself whatever  i am just going to write
